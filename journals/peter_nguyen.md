# W14D1

Front end mockup was discussed as well as what css libraries
we wanted to use.
We later agreed that bootstrap would be preferred


# W14D2

After messing with bootstrap for the day, decided to scrap it after encountering multiple errors
while making a sidebar navigation menu.

Decided to make a navbar from scratch using traditional html and css that is currently working.


# W14D3

- Made a card for Accounts and added some css styling for it.
- Fixed issue with icons for the nav bar not showing.
