# The Days of Our Coding

## W14D1 - Auth

`Woke up this morning feeling fine; /
Had some fun code on my mind. /
Started with some stand-up with my team. /
Beau was driving; we were living the dream.`

`Hit some errors but we didn't care. /
Debugging like bosses, wind in our hair, /
Requests got 200s so we said, "That's it! /
Call it a day, save, add, commit.`

`Little did we know...`

## W14D2 - Auth Strikes Back

### A haiku
`How could this happen?
All day just bugs and errors...
Betrayed by repos.`

### For Real Though
`
At the end of the day, it seems we got auth working alright.
Got back the 200s for our create account requests, responses looked right.
Tomorrow we will re-attack and make sure login/logout work before working on endpoints for messages.
We also need to clean up our queries so that the hashed password is getting written to the db instead of the normal one.
