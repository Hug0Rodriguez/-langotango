# The Days of Our Coding

## W14D1 - Auth

`Woke up this morning feeling fine; /
Had some fun code on my mind. /
Started with some stand-up with my team. /
Beau was driving; we were living the dream.`

`Hit some errors but we didn't care. /
Debugging like bosses, wind in our hair, /
Requests got 200s so we said, "That's it! /
Call it a day, save, add, commit.`

`Little did we know...`

## W14D2 - Auth Strikes Back

### A haiku

`How could this happen?
All day just bugs and errors...
Betrayed by repos.`

### For Real Though

`At the end of the day, it seems we got auth working alright.
Got back the 200s for our create account requests, responses looked right.
Tomorrow we will re-attack and make sure login/logout work before working on endpoints for messages.
We also need to clean up our queries so that the hashed password is getting written to the db instead of the normal one.`

## W14D3

### Auth

`We completed auth today and ensured that get token, login, logout, and create user all work as expected.
We merged the branch into main and closed out the relevant issues.`

### Messages

`We began writing models for our messages, but quickly realized that we need to actually clarify our intent for data flow and API usage.
We spent much of the afternoon doing additional research and agreed that by COB tomorrow we would have our APIs chosen and documented.`
