## Project Intent

### Background

When brainstorming for the project, Beau pointed out that languages apps like Duolingo are very heavy on vocab and grammar, but don't do a good job at giving the user speaking practice. He had a great idea for a langauge app that would allow the user to speak in a foreign language and receive a response back in-language.

### Application Objective

We want to provide an application, as stated above, that allows users to practice their target language conversationally. To this end, we have designed our application so that, building on our MVP, users will have features available to them that help them improve their conversational abilities with well-paced feedback in an environment that makes the learner  feel safe and comfortable.

## MVP Criteria

Our application must, at minimum:

- Allow users to provide audio input in at least two languages
- Convert user speech into text
- Send a message to a chatbot and receive a response in target language
- Convert the text response back into audio
- Push the audio data back to the front end for the user
